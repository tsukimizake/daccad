# Code Style
- Before starting design, read the cargo.toml to see if any useful utility package is installed. Especially, don't forget to use bevy-async-ecs. Never make a queue yourself.
- If you got lost or think there is any misunderstanding on me, feel free to ask me.
- Don't write too obvious comments. Add comments only when the function/variable names and the types cannot explain the specification.
